              Would Alaska’s Mount Denali – the highest peak in the US – be as tall if it was situated on the
              equator instead? Might the Himalayas be even taller if an ice age took hold?

              <p data-item>The world's tallest mountain ranges form when pieces of Earth's crust—called plates—smash
                against each
                other in a process called plate tectonics, and buckle up like the hood of a car in a head-on collision.
                The Himalaya in Asia formed from one such massive wreck that started about 55 million years ago. Thirty
                of the world’s highest mountains are in the Himalaya. The summit of Mount Everest, at 29,035 feet (8,850
                meters), is the highest point on Earth. The tallest mountain measured from top to bottom is Mauna Kea,
                an inactive volcano on the island of Hawaii in the Pacific Ocean. Measured from the base, Mauna Kea
                stands 33,474 feet (10,203 meters) tall, though it only rises 13,796 feet (4,205 meters) above the sea.

              <p data-item>Volcanic mountains form when molten rock from deep inside the Earth erupts through the crust
                and piles
                up on itself. The islands of Hawaii were formed by undersea volcanoes, and the islands seen above water
                today are the remaining volcano tops. Well-known volcanoes on land include Mount St. Helens in
                Washington State and Mount Fuji in Japan. Sometimes volcanic eruptions break down mountains instead of
                building them up, like the 1980 eruption that blew the top off Mount St. Helens.</p>

              <p data-item>When magma pushes the crust up but hardens before erupting onto the surface, it forms
                so-called dome mountains. Wind and rain pummel the domes, sculpting peaks and valleys. Examples include
                the Black Hills of South Dakota and the Adirondack Mountains of New York. Plateau mountains are similar
                to dome mountains, but form as colliding tectonic plates push up the land without folding or faulting.
                They are then shaped by weathering and erosion. Other types of mountains form when stresses within and
                between the tectonic plates lead to cracking and faulting of the Earth's surface, which forces blocks of
                rock up and down. Examples of fault-block mountains include the Sierra Nevada in California and Nevada,
                the Tetons in Wyoming, and the Harz Mountains in Germany. Mountains often serve as geographic features
                that define natural borders of countries. Their height can influence weather patterns, stalling storms
                that roll off the oceans and squeezing water from the clouds. The other side is often much drier. The
                rugged landscapes even provide refuge—and protection—for fleeing and invading armies.</p>
